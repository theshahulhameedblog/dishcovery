### Camera & Photo Issues

**Q: Why can't I take photos?**
A: Make sure you've granted DishcoveryNow camera permissions:
1. Go to iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera
2. Find "DishcoveryNow" and toggle it ON
3. Restart the app

**Q: Why can't I select photos from my library?**
A: Check photo library permissions:
1. Go to iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos
2. Find "DishcoveryNow" and select "All Photos" or "Selected Photos"
3. Restart the app

**Q: My photos are blurry or not processing correctly**
A: For best results:
- Ensure good lighting (avoid shadows and glare)
- Hold your device steady
- Keep the menu flat and in focus
- Avoid tilted or angled shots
- Make sure text is clearly visible

### Translation & Results

**Q: Why wasn't any dish detected?**
A: This can happen if:
- The image is too blurry or dark
- The menu text is too small or unclear
- The menu is handwritten (AI works best with printed text)
- There's excessive glare or shadows

**Tips for better results:**
- Take photos in good lighting
- Get closer to the menu for clearer text
- Use the crop tool to focus on specific sections
- Try multiple angles if needed

**Q: The translation seems incorrect**
A: While our AI is highly accurate, occasional errors can occur with:
- Specialized culinary terms
- Regional dialects or slang
- Handwritten menus
- Decorative fonts

If you notice an error, try retaking the photo with better lighting or a clearer angle.

**Q: Can I save my translation results?**
A: Currently, DishcoveryNow shows your most recent scan. We're working on adding a history feature in future updates!

### Nutrition & Allergen Information

**Q: How accurate is the nutritional information?**
A: We source nutritional data from:
- **Nutritionix**: Commercial food database (high accuracy)
- **USDA FoodData Central**: Government nutrition database
- **AI Estimates**: When exact matches aren't available

Estimates are based on common recipes and serving sizes. Actual values may vary by restaurant.

**Q: Why is allergen information missing for some dishes?**
A: Allergen detection is based on:
- Listed ingredients in the menu (if available)
- Common recipe knowledge
- AI analysis of dish descriptions

When uncertain, we err on the side of caution and omit allergen tags rather than provide potentially incorrect information. **Always verify with restaurant staff if you have severe allergies.**

**Q: I have a severe food allergy. Can I rely on DishcoveryNow?**
A: **No.** DishcoveryNow is a helpful guide, but **should not be used as the sole source** for allergen information. Always:
- Confirm with restaurant staff
- Ask about cross-contamination
- Read menu disclaimers
- Inform servers of severe allergies
