## Introduction

Welcome to Dishcovery ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Information We Collect

### Camera and Photo Library Access
- **Camera Access**: Dishcovery requires camera access to capture photos of restaurant menus for translation purposes.
- **Photo Library Access**: The app may access your photo library to allow you to select previously taken menu photos.

### Menu Image Processing
- **Image Data**: When you capture or select a menu photo, the image is:
  - Temporarily compressed on your device
  - Sent to OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API for menu analysis and translation
  - Not stored permanently on our servers
  - Processed according to OpenAI's data usage policies

### Data We DO NOT Collect
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers for advertising
- Browsing history or app usage analytics
- Any data from other apps on your device

## How We Use Your Information

The menu images you provide are used solely for:
1. **Menu Translation**: Extracting dish names and translating them to your preferred language
2. **Dish Information**: Providing descriptions, ingredients, allergen warnings, and nutritional data
3. **Image Recognition**: Processing images through OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API

## Data Storage and Retention

### On Your Device
- The most recent menu translation result is cached locally on your device for quick access
- You can clear this data by closing and reopening the app
